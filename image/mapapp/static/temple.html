            The Sirkazhi Sattainathar Temple, also known as the Sirkali Temple or Sattainathar Temple, is a renowned Hindu temple located in the town of Sirkazhi in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is considered one of the prominent pilgrimage sites in the region. The temple holds immense religious significance and attracts devotees from far and wide, especially during festivals and auspicious occasions.

One of the distinctive features of the Sirkazhi Sattainathar Temple is its association with the legendary Saivite saint, Tirugnanasambandar, who is one of the prominent Nayanars, the revered devotees of Lord Shiva. According to legend, Tirugnanasambandar is said to have miraculously revived a dead child at this very site, which further enhances the sanctity and reverence of the temple.
